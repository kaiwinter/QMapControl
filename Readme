What is QMapControl?
====================

QMapControl is a Qt/Qtopia widget which enables your (mobile) applications to
use map data. Simply add the widget to your application, have a look at the API
and start developing a fancy geospatial mobile application.

With QMapControl you can use different map providers, like OpenStreetMap or
several WMS-Servers. Then you can modify the view of your QMapControl, writing
a location based application when having a GPS receiver or just browse the
maps. It is possible to have more than one layer, so you can mix maps from
different servers. To enrich the maps you can draw your own object to
coordinates.

Feature list:

    * Compatible with multiple map providers (Tile server and WMS server)
    * Draw custom objects into maps (lines, points, images, even other Qt widgets!)
    * Objects can be added to any coordinate
    * Control elements can be added to QMapControl´s layout
    * Added objects emit signals on clicks
    * The map navigation is customizable (using styles and/or keys)
    * GPS parser included for reading gllin output
