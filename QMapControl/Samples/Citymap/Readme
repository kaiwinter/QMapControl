This demo appclication shows more features of the QMapControl. It shows images, which changes its size when changing the zoomlevel. You can display/hide layers and choose different map providers. Also it demonstrates more possibilities for user interaction:
 
- notes can be added to any coordinate (a QTextEdit is used for editing the note)
- the user can measure distances between two points
