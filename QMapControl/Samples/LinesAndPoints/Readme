/*!
 * \example linesandpoints.cpp
 * This application demonstrates how to use Geometry objects and how to add them to a layer.
 * 
 * Here are used three different point types:
 *  - One which displays a image
 *  - One which draws a plain circle
 *  - One which uses a QPen to draw a circle
 *  - One which has no markers
 * Then these Points were added to a LineString
 * 
 * Also there is a keylistener.
 * 
 * You can find this example here: MapAPI/Samples/LinesAndPoints
